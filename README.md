# python-api-challenge
The code in this repository is an activity that implements API keys, Pandas, and Matplotlib. In the file WeatherPy, code can be found that uses data from OpenWeatherMap API and analyzes the data from a random selection of cities across the globe. The data is further visualized using Matplotlib, via the creation of scatterplots, examining the relationship between certain variables. Furthermore, regression analysis is conducted on the data, this time separated into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. .png files for all of the plots generated in this portion can be found within the output_data file within WeatherPy, along with the .csv file of the raw data of the cities.

In the second part of this activity, Google Maps API is used. In VacationPy, you will find code that generates a heat map based on the humidity of the cities. Then, the data is filtered further by an arbitrary set of weather conditions, creating an "ideal location" to visit. Google Places API is used to then find a hotel within 5000 meters of the city. This is then placed on top of the heat map as pins, with the name of the hotel in the info box. The .png snapshots of the heat maps can be found in the output_data folder within VacationPy.
